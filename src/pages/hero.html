        enthusiastic, honest, and patient person who loves to learn. I work with
        discipline and take my tasks seriously, but sometimes I’m afraid of
        making mistakes. My strength is front-end development. I am good at HTML
        and CSS, and I’m still learning JavaScript, SASS, ReactJS, and
        Git.</span
